She had many names. By birth - Elmeskhan Khagundokova, then Gali Bazhenova and, finally, Irene de Luard, Circassian Beauty, a rank-and-file of the army of fashion, the Commander of a mobile hospital, a Resistance hero, and the godmother of a regiment in the Foreign Legion.

 WW1
1914-1918  Elmeshan, a graduate from Smolny, with her mother and sisters, went to Kislovodsk, where she was admitted to the hospital as a nurse.  There, she met her future husband Nikolai Bazhenov. Nikolai was seriously wounded in the head and ended up in a hospital where Gali worked. Young people fell in love and got married in St. Petersburg. She changed her name to Gali Bozhenova after marriage. 

 Soon after the revolution, their son Nikolai was born. The family was forced to flee the revolution to China. There, Gali's husband Nikolai Bazhenov fell seriously ill, the consequences of a head wound. And there he died.
  
FASHION

Gali Bazhenova, « the Russian beauty of the House of Chanel » as she was called by Paris fashion magazines in the 1920s. 

 In 1922, Gali and her son moved to France, which gave shelter to many of Russian emigrants, including her father's large family. In 1923, the "Russian beauty" Bazhenova, as the Parisian fashion magazines called her, became the darling of secular society.

Coco Chanel, on the advice of Prince Kutuzov, invites Gali to work, and her face begins to flicker on the pages of the most popular publications - Femina and Vogue. The exquisite beauty became the "secular fashion model" of the Chanel House. This was one of the categories of models of that time: fashion models with a rare appearance or a high-profile title received dresses to go out to social events.
Later, Elmiskhan Khagundokova opens her own Elmis Fashion House, which specialized in tailoring exquisite evening dresses with embroidery. During the years of the economic crisis, the Elmis Fashion House, like most Russian fashion houses, could not stand the competition and closed. 
In 1934, Gali marries her second husband, Count Stanislas de Loire, converts to Catholicism and changes her name to Irene. Gali's husband was in the civil service, a senator, the son of a marquis. 
As proof of his love until his death in 1980, her husband encouraged her thirst for entrepreneurship, a thirst for action and giving.

WW2
 
During the war, Countess Irene de Loire organized mobile operating rooms based on trucks, which allowed them to work literally on the front line. There were twenty such trucks. The idea turned out to be more than successful. Her mobile hospitals were nicknamed "flying", and she herself became famous throughout France.
French General Dubost recalled: “This organization, which she founded, included about two hundred people, a quarter of them surgeons. The hospital in a short time was deployed near the front to operate on the most severe wounded. Mobile surgery No. 1 has always followed its patroness, full of dedication and unwavering courage.”
She then set up a mobile surgical hospital in North Africa, where she treated thousands of typhoid and cholera patients, and moved with her medical staff to Italy at the height of the war, where she saved hundreds of lives during the historic battle of Monte Cassino. She took part in the liberation of Italy and received the Legion of Honor from the French President General de Gaulle. The choice of the location of the hospitals was not accidental - it was in this region that her son Nikolai served as part of the US Armed Forces in the corps of General Clark, who by that time had overseas citizenship. The entire combat path of the brave Irene de Luire from North Africa to Italy coincided with the movements of her beloved son, who, having survived in the hellish heat of the war, died untimely in 1954 from a brain tumor. The whole world began to provide her financial assistance. She used all the donations to expand her activities, and it turned out that by the end of the war, Gali had saved the lives of several tens of thousands of people.
 
 


General De Gaulle welcomes Irene du Loire. Algeria, 5 March 1944.

She has always been where the danger is. Always ahead. After each surgical operation, supervised personally, she was with the patients until they are awake to cheer them up, like a mother. The Countess de Loire managed to get ahead of the advancing Allied troops and was the first to cross with her hospital through the Franco-German border. 

The popularity of her machine is even greater. The Foreign Legion requested her patronage. She was the favorite of French Marshal Alphonse Juin, who, when he first saw the lady on the front line, told her:

"Go away, there's nothing for you to do here."

"But what do you care?" Gali replied. “I am not a soldier, and you have no right to command.

- This is my area! I'm in command here!
Soldiers - yes! Not for me!
And she stayed. Later they became friends, and when she was awarded the Order of the Commander, the marshal himself came to present it.

After the war

After the war, she continued her mission - she built and restored hospitals in North Africa, fought epidemics of typhus and cholera, and organized a rehabilitation complex in Algeria, where its own war was brewing. There she set up "Centres Luare". These were places for recreation, and they were intended for young people who fought there, who could forget about the horrors of war there for a while. When the only son of the Countess de Loire died in the mid-1950s, she devoted herself entirely to charity. 

She built an inter-army recreation center at her own expense, intended for soldiers who had no families and no means of subsistence. “Godmother,” the legionnaires of her native First Foreign Cavalry Regiment lovingly continued to call Irene, and she continued to take care of them. 

FAREWELL


She died in 1985 at the age of 87. The day before she was diagnosed with leukemia and predicted the date of death. And in this situation, she behaved with dignity: she put on a beautiful dress, a pearl necklace, made a beautiful hairstyle and waited.

 Galya's funeral was in the category of a French marshal. Her coffin, on a cannon carriage, accompanied by a regiment of the Foreign Legion, was taken to the cemetery of Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois, where her son rests. Gali was buried next to him. Parisian magazines wrote: “All Paris said goodbye to her. France said goodbye to her. Numerous Russian emigrants who had long ago become French or who were born French said goodbye to her.”  All of  The First Cavalry Regiment of the Foreign Legion said goodbye to her. 

Irene, tears in my eyes,
We came to tell you: "Farewell..."

“We have come to pay our last respects to the Comtesse de Loire. A great woman with inexhaustible generosity, a legendary figure in her mercy and help to the wounded.’’
