            <p> Born on September 6th, 1898 in St Petersburg, Russia. Elmeskhan studied at the Smolny Institute. She
                came
                from an aristocratic noble (warki) Kabardian family of the Khagundokovs.
                <br><br>
                <b> Father:</b> General Konstantin Nikolaevich Khagundokov was the commander of the second brigade of
                the Wild
                Division of the Russian Imperial Army and the owner of many awards for his courage and heroism,
                including the St. George Cross and St. George weapons.
                <br><br>
                <b>Mother: </b>Elizaveta Emilyevna Bredova came from a family of an ancient family of German aristocrats
                of the
                German Empire from Polabian Slavs, relatives of aristocratic families.

                Elmeshan, a graduate from Smolny went to Kislovodsk (a town in South Russia) with her mother and
                sisters, where she was
                admitted to the hospital as a nurse.
                <br><br>
                There she met her future husband Nikolai Bazhenov. Nikolai was seriously wounded in the head and ended
                up in a hospital where Gali worked. Young people fell in love and got married in St. Petersburg. She
                changed her name to Gali Bozhenova after marriage. <br><br>
                Soon after the revolution, their son Nikolai was born. The family was forced to flee to
                China, where Gali's husband Nikolai Bazhenov fell seriously ill and died.

                    <p id="img-caption">Gali Bazhenova, « the Russian beauty of the House of Chanel » as she was called
                        by

                    In 1922, Gali and her son moved to France, which gave shelter to many of Russian emigrants,
                    including
                    her father's large family. In 1923, the "Russian beauty" Bazhenova, as the Parisian fashion
                    magazines
                    called her, became the darling of secular society.
                    <br><br>

                    Coco Chanel, on the advice of Prince Kutuzov, invites Gali to work, and her face begins to flicker
                    on
                    the pages of the most popular publications - Femina and Vogue. The exquisite beauty became the
                    "secular
                    fashion model" of the Chanel House. This was one of the categories of models of that time: fashion
                    models with a rare appearance or a high-profile title received dresses to go out to social events.
                    <br><br>
                    Later, Elmiskhan Khagundokova opens her own Elmis Fashion House, which specialized in tailoring
                    exquisite evening dresses with embroidery. During the years of the economic crisis, the Elmis
                    Fashion
                    House, like most Russian fashion houses, could not stand the competition and closed.

                    In 1934, Gali marries her second husband, Count Stanislas de Loire, converts to Catholicism and
                    changes
                    her name to Irene. Gali's husband was in the civil service, a senator, the son of a marquis. <br>
                    As proof of his love until his death in 1980, her husband encouraged her thirst for
                    entrepreneurship, a
                    thirst for action and giving.
