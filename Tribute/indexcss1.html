            <p> Born on September 6th, 1898 in St Petersburg, Russia. Elmeskhan
                came
                from an aristocratic noble (warki) Kabardian family of the Khagundokovs.
                <br><br>
                <b> Father:</b> General Konstantin Nikolaevich Khagundokov was the commander of the second brigade of
                the Wild
                Division of the Russian Imperial Army and the owner of many awards for his courage and heroism,
                including the St. George Cross and St. George weapons.
                <br><br>
                <b>Mother: </b>Elizaveta Emilyevna Bredova came from an ancient family of German aristocrats
                of the
                German Empire from Polabian Slavs, relatives of aristocratic families.

                During WWI, Elmeshan, a graduate from Smolny Institute went to Kislovodsk (a town in South Russia) with
                her mother and
                sisters, where she was
                admitted to the hospital as a nurse.
                <br><br>
                There she met her future husband Nikolai Bazhenov, who was brought to the hospital with a serious head
                injury. Young people fell in love and got married in St. Petersburg. She
                changed her name to Gali Bozhenova after marriage. <br><br>
                Soon after the revolution, their son Nikolai was born. The family was forced to flee to
                China, where Gali's husband Nikolai Bazhenov fell seriously ill and died.

                    <br><br>
                    In 1922, Gali and her son moved to France, which gave shelter to many of Russian emigrants,
                    including
                    her father's large family. In 1923, the "Russian beauty" Bazhenova, as the Parisian fashion
                    magazines
                    called her, became the darling of secular society.
                    <br><br>

                    Coco Chanel, on the advice of Prince Kutuzov, invites Gali to work, and her face begins to flicker
                    on
                    the pages of the most popular publications - Femina and Vogue. The exquisite beauty became the
                    "secular
                    fashion model" of the Chanel House. This was one of the categories of models of that time: fashion
                    models with a rare appearance or a high-profile title received dresses to go out to social events.

                    <br><br>
                    Later, Gali opens her own Elmis Fashion House, which specialized in tailoring
                    exquisite evening dresses with embroidery. During the years of the economic crisis, the Elmis
                    Fashion
                    House, like most Russian fashion houses, could not withstand competition and closed.

                    <br><br>
                    In 1934, Gali marries her second husband, Count Stanislas du Loire, converts to Catholicism and
                    changes
                    her name to Irene. Stanislav was in the civil service, a senator, the son of a marquis. <br>
                    <br>
                    As proof of his love, Count Du Loire encouraged her thirst for
                    entrepreneurship, a
                    thirst for action and giving, until his death in 1980.

                    During the war, Countess Irene du Loire organized mobile operating rooms based on trucks, which
                    allowed them to work literally on the front line. There were twenty such trucks. The idea turned out
                    to be more than successful. Her mobile hospitals were nicknamed "flying", and she became
                    famous throughout France.
                    <br><br>
                    French General Dubost recalled: <strong> “This organization she founded included about two hundred
                        people, a quarter of them surgeons. The hospital in a short time was deployed near the front to
                        operate on the most severe wounded. Mobile surgery No. 1 has always followed its patroness, full
                        of
                        dedication and unwavering courage.”</strong>
                    <br><br>

            <div id="WWII2">
                <p>
                    She then set up a mobile surgical hospital in North Africa, where she treated thousands of typhoid
                    and cholera patients, and moved with her medical staff to Italy at the height of the war, where she
                    saved hundreds of lives during the historic battle of Monte Cassino.
                    <br> <br>
                    The choice of
                    the location of the hospitals was not accidental. The entire combat path coincided
                    with the movements of her beloved son Nikolai, who, having survived in the hellish heat of the war,
                    died
                    untimely in 1954 from a brain tumor.
                    <br> <br>
                    The whole world began to provide her financial assistance. She
                    used all the donations to expand her activities, and it turned out that <strong> by the end of the
                        war, Irene had saved over seveal tens of thousans of lives.

                    She has always been where the danger is. Always ahead. After each surgical operation, supervised
                    personally, she was with the patients until they are awake to cheer them up, like a mother. The
                    Countess du Loire managed to get ahead of the advancing Allied troops and was the first to cross
                    through the Franco-German border with her hospital.


                    <br><br>

                    She was
                    the favorite of French Marshal Alphonse Juin, who, when he first saw the lady on the front line,
                    told her:

                    <br>
                    -What do you care?- Irene replied - I'm not a soldier, and you have no right to command me.
                    <br>
                    - This is my area! I'm in command here!

                    -Soldiers - yes! Not for me!
                    <br>
                    And she stayed. Later they became friends, and when she was awarded the Order of the Commander, the
                    marshal himself came to present it.
